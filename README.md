# Much-Assembly-Required-Frontend
Files for https://muchassemblyrequired.com/ frontend.

Requires a PHP environnment and a MySQL server (Database installation script: [database.sql](https://github.com/simon987/Much-Assembly-Required-Frontend/blob/master/database.sql)).

Easiest way to configure the database:
```bash
$ pwd
~/Much-Assembly-Required-Frontend/
$ mysql -u root -p < database.sql
Enter password:  # type your MySQL root user password if you set any
                 # on a fresh install the password is empty
                 # NOTE: on a fresh install you might have to run the command with sudo
                 # NEVER blindly run commands as sudo. Check the contents of the 'database.sql' file first!
```
